    ## Abstract

    Omeka is a free Content Management System (CMS) and a web publishing system built by and for scholars that is used by hundreds of archives, historical societies, libraries, museums, and individual researchers and teachers to create searchable online databases and scholarly online interpretations of their digital collections. If you have a digital collection of primary sources that you want to publish online in a scholarly way, you’ll want to consider Omeka.
    Omeka allows to describe the items according to archival standards, import and export that descriptive information from other systems, and to create as many interpretive online exhibits as you like from those items.

    Through this workshop, we are going to create and populate a database with artifacts from B. Altman’s & Co., the department store that until January 1990 resided in the building that now houses CUNY's Graduate Center. We are then going to create a sample exhibition that uses the items in our collections to tell the story of the store in the first two decades of the 1900s.

    ## Learning Objectives

    In this workshop, you will learn the following skills:

    - Understand some of the conceptual challenges faced when developing digital archives 
    - Create an online database of digital archival items
    - Create a public facing exhibition featuring items from your collections
    - Consider using Omeka as a teaching tool in undergraduate and graduate classes 

    ## Estimated time

    Three hours.

    ## Prerequisites

    - [Getting Started with Omeka.net](sections/omekainstall.md) 

    ### Pre-reading suggestions

    - Something about Digital Archives?

    ### Projects that use these skills

    - [The City of Boston archives](https://cityofbostonarchives.omeka.net/) is an excellent example of an Okema website in which a selected set of data from a larger database, most likely managed by a different CMS, was imported. The City of Boston archives relies on the basic functions of Omeka that we are going to explore today to catalogue and display a set of items, sort them into collections, and use them to tell stories in the form of digital exhibitions. 

    - [Colored Conventions](http://coloredconventions.org/) is a website that uses Omeka a stand-alone CMS and fully takes advantage of the platform's potential. This collaborative project aims to collect rare proceedings, newspaper coverage, and petitions from state and national political meetings of once captive Black people between 1830 and 1890. Colored Conventions is also a great example of how Omeka and digital archiving can work as pedagogical tools. It received awards from the MLA, ASA, and PCA/ACA along with grants from the NEH, Mellon Foundation, and CLI.

    - [East Bay Punk Digital Archive](www.eastbaypunkda.com) The East Bay Punk Digital Archive (EBP-DA) is a project spearheaded by Stefano Morello and funded by the [Digital Initiatives](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/),  [Lost & Found](https://www.centerforthehumanities.org/lost-and-found), and the [New Media Lab](https://www.centerforthehumanities.org/lost-and-found) at The Graduate Center, CUNY. It aims to preserve and make available – to researchers, subcultural participants from around the world, and a general public unfamiliar with the topic – the subjugated knowledge produced by participants in the punk-rock commons that loomed in and around the San Francisco Bay Area between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s. 

    ### Ethical Considerations

    - Something on Copyright?
